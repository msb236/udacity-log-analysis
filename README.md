# udacity-log-analysis

Report on popularity of articles and authors as well as usage error rates for a wiki-like article application. This is the first of two projects for the third part of the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program -- The Backend Databases & Applications.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisits

This project assumes you have staged the required [source data](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57b5f748_newsdata/newsdata.zip) into a local psql database.

### Install

Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/msb236/udacity-log-analysis.git
```

### Command Line Execution

To run the log analyzer report, cd into the top-level directory of the package, `udacity-log-analysis`. Then, run the `loganalyzer` folder as a python package.

```
python -m loganalyzer
```

## Design Notes

The source data model is augmented with a view, [`article_views`](https://github.com/msb236/udacity-log-analysis/blob/master/loganalyzer/queries/article_views.sql), that gives view counts by slug.
